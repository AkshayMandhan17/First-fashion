# First-fashion
This was a paid website template that i really liked so i coded it myself

When I started learning web development in 2019, I used to try and replicate web templates to test if i was good enough to create projects that are available
for sale online.

First fashion was one of my favourite websites that i completed by myself, I tried to replicate each and every little detail of this particular project.

1 third party software known as WOW Slider is also being used in this website for creating the slider on the home page of the website, Moreover I used fontawesome
to use some cool fonts as well.
